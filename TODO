Write the graphics renderer
	use ncurses, primitive but good for a couple reasons:
		Deals with characters instead of pixels, which is fine for this
		can be used to handle keyboard input also

Implement the remaining opcodes
	they mostly deal with IO and using the call stack

Write an assembler and/or disassembler
	could do the assembler in perl to make parsing ez
	the disassembler could be combined with the item below

Write a program that will print the instructions of a CHIP-8 program in human readable format
	include an option that will toggle whether it follows conditional branches or does a straight dump
