An emulator for the CHIP-8 architecture.

Technically this isn't a true emulator since CHIP-8 was actually an interpreted programming language and wasn't implemented directly in hardware.  Its purpose was to make programming games easier by providing a common instruction set that would work across multiple platforms.

See the links below for more info and the specification that was followed

This doesn't use any special libraries apart from ncurses so it *should* compile on unix based systems without too much trouble.  When running it make sure the terminal window is at least 64x32 characters wide so things will display correctly.
