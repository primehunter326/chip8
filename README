An intepreter for the CHIP-8 programming language.

CHIP-8 was an interpreted programming language that was used on some 8 bit computers in the 70s.  Its purpose was to make programming games easier by providing a common instruction set that would work across multiple platforms.

See the links below for more info and the specification that was followed

This doesn't use any special libraries apart from ncurses so it *should* compile on unix based systems without too much trouble.  When running it make sure the terminal window is at least 64x32 characters wide so things will display correctly.

I'm doing this as a an introduction to writing emulators and it is still very much a work in progress.
